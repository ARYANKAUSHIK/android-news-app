# Art History News

A simple app that fetches art history news from the Guardian API. The app fires up an AsyncTask to get the JSON results, parses them, creates custom Article objects, and binds a RecyclerView with an Adapter. Clicking on the "Read Story" button launches the browser where you can read the full article.
